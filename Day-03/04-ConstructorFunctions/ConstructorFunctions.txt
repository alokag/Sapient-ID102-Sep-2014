Constructor Functions

1. A constructor function is invoked with "new" keyword
2. "this" refers to a new object
3. "this" is returned by default

Create a Constructor function to create "Product" objects. The product object expected to exhibit the following characteristics

Attributes
	id
	name
	unitCost
	discountPercentage
Methods
	getValue() -> should return the actula value of the product (unitCost - discount)

Usage:
======
var p = new Product(1,"Pen",100,10);
p.getValue() //=> 90

Solution:
=========

function Product(id,name,unitCost,discountPercent){
	this.id = id;
	this.name = name;
	this.unitCost = unitCost;
	this.discountPercent = discountPercent;
	this.getValue = function(){
		return this.unitCost * ((100 - this.discountPercent)/100)
	}
}

Assignment:
===========
convert id, name, unitCost & discountPercent into accessor methods so that the following validations can be performed when the values are assigned to the attributes

Validations:
-------------
	id -> should be > 0
	name -> should NOT be an empty string
	unitCost -> should be > 0
	discountPercent -> should be > 0 and < 100
